# reducer

C++ repository for boolean algebraic reduction. Utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search for finding approximately optimal forms.

This project uses clangd as intellisense and g++ as compiler.

clangd expects c++12 stdlib headers to be installed. This can be done with:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev
```
